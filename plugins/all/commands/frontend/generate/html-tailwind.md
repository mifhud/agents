- If design, code or html is provided, IMPORTANT: respect the original/foundation design in design system.

- Any CSS styles should be in the style attribute.

- If there are charts, use chart.js for charts (avoid bug: if your canvas is on the same level as other nodes: h2 p canvas div = infinite grows. h2 p div>canvas div = as intended.)
